### üîç **Solution Highlights**
- **Optimal Time Complexity**:  
  Each solution is designed with time complexity in mind to provide the most efficient approach.
- **Edge Cases Handled**:  
  Each solution accounts for common edge cases that could break a naive implementation.

### üîß **Technologies Used**
- **C Programming Language**:  
  All solutions are written in C, leveraging the language's efficiency in solving algorithmic problems.
- **GCC Compiler**:  
  Used for compiling the C code to run on various systems.
- **LeetCode**:  
  All the problems are sourced from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), a leading platform for coding challenges.

### üìà **Performance Optimization**
I focus on optimizing for both **time** and **space** complexity. Each solution is tested against multiple test cases and includes improvements like:
- **Early Exits** for reducing runtime.
- **Efficient Data Structures** to optimize space.
